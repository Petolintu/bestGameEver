Made during Finnish Game Jam 2024 by a three-person team with basically zero prior Unity experience. The game has old school online game vibes and is hard as f*ck. 

As you can see, the graphics are demanding and top-notch! MS Paint is awesome, right?

Everything except the background music was made during the game jam. 

Potential investors cannot be accepted right now because of the overwhelming demand to sponsor the game!
